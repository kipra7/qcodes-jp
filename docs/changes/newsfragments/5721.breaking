QCoDeS is now type checked to ensure that subclasses are implemented in a way consistent with the parent class.
This has resulted in a number of changes to the API. The following is a list of the changes that have been made
to the API to make subclasses match their parent class. These changes are not expected to break any existing code, since they are
primarily in positional arguments or unused arguments.

* The first argument to `NumpyJSONEncoder.default` has changed from `obj` to `o` to match the naming in the std library `json.JSONEncoder.default`.
* Unused args `idn_part` and `being_time` to `QDevQDac.connect_message` have been changed to `idn_param` and `begin_time` respectively to match the parent class.
* Unused arguments to stub methods `DSOTraceParam.setpoints`, `DSOTraceParam.unit` and `FormattedSweep.setpoints` have been changed to match the parent class.
* Alazar `DemodulationAcquisitionController.handle_buffer` the first argument has been renamed from `data` to `buffer` to match the parent class.
