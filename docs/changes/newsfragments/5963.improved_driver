A number of new parameters are added to the Keysight N9030B Spectrum Analyzer to allow for Noise Spectral Density measurements.
In particular we add various parameters for switching the detectors into the appropriate modes, as well as allowing for
instrument parameters required for unit conversions to be saved in the snapshot.

In addition, we use binary readout of the data and the ability to read data from the instrument buffer
(without taking a new trace), and to read averaged data.
