QCoDeS no longer installs opencensus and opencensus-ext-azure are no longer installed by default and opencensus integration is deprecated.
This means that the option ``qcodes.config.telemetry.enabled`` to ``True`` is deprecated. For the time being opencensus and opencensus-ext-azure
can be installed by installing QCoDeS with the opencensus option e.g. ``pip install qcodes[opencensus]``. We however, recommend that any use
of this telemetry integration is replaced by the use of OpenTelemetry. QCoDeS will not include any telemetry integration but the codebase
has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry spans and python log messages enabling any user to collect telemetry if they should so wish.
